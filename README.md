  ## Usage

  It is an easy to use click driven program. To create a workout, enter the workout name into the input filed titled "Workout Name" and hit submit. You should be able to see your workout down below now. To create an exercise, simply use the input fields on the right of the display. If you wish to associate the exercise with a workout you may enter the workout name at the top but this is not necissary as you can add a exercise to a workout later if you choose.
